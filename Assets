Prospective Asset list:
  For Animal Abuse
     Come up with image ideas - mostlikely showing how beating your children will end up with you being arrested and in jail and it is the same with animals 
     Or if you wouldn't do it to your kids, why do it to your animal? But there are those psychos out there who also beat their kids so this arguement fails for them :/
  For Hockey
    Find cartoon (if a consistent across all sports and legal cartoon) to show each sport acting the same
    If no cartoon - pick a couple of the biggest arguments of why other sports are better and use those real life examples (photography from the games) and show the hockey players in real life doing the same
      this might be really hard to visually make it to be appealing since sports across the board do not use the same colors/logos - could end for a busy screen to look at 
      would much prefer finding a cartoon
